Project Title: Apple Quality Prediction Model

Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of an apple fruit based on various parameters such as size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. Two models were developed using different libraries: one with TensorFlow achieving an accuracy of 0.87 and another with scikit-learn achieving an accuracy of 0.77.

Dataset:
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of observations of apple fruits with corresponding quality ratings based on the specified parameters. Each observation includes measurements for size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, acidity, and the quality rating.

Models:
TensorFlow Model:
Library: TensorFlow
Accuracy: 0.87
This model was trained using a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The neural network was optimized to predict apple quality based on the provided parameters.
Scikit-Learn Model:
Library: scikit-learn
Accuracy: 0.77
This model was trained using machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn. Various algorithms were experimented with, and the model achieving the highest accuracy was selected for evaluation.

Instructions:
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks (tensorflow_model.ipynb and sklearn_model.ipynb) to explore the model implementations, training process, and evaluation results.
The dataset.csv file contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Feel free to explore and modify the dataset as needed.
For further experimentation or improvement of the models, adjust the model architectures, hyperparameters, or explore additional machine learning algorithms.

Note:
This project is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes. The models' accuracies are based on the provided dataset and may vary in real-world scenarios.
